# insurance-predictor using ANN and multiple linear regression
here we build a regressor model to predict the premium of a person

here we encodes the categorical variabkes and then apply multiple linear regression 

we get a root mean squared error of "5641"

we perform the same model with ann using keras and obtained a Rmse of "6041"
Ann model is saved in "insurancepred.h5" file
